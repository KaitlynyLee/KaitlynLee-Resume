Some Background:
Although I currently reside in Riverside, my hometown is the city of West Hills. Some of my hobbies include playing the flute and taking care of my health. I have been playing the flute for 7 years and I have been cooking healthy and regularly attending the gym. 
<br><br>

       ADDITIONAL SKILLS & INTERESTS 
Due to my experience of working with customers over the past few years, I have developed many skills relevant to marketing and customer interaction. 
      Skills: team oriented, oral and written communication skills, easily adaptable, level-headed, professionalism, customer service, technologically advanced (tech-forward), creative/innovative ideas, experience with Excel, flexibility, versatile, Conversational in Korean Language, Limited working proficiency in Spanish
I graduated highschool with the seal of biliteracy, however I have limited vocabulary and experience. I am relatively fluent in Korean as my parents speak Korean at home. 

At UC Riverside, I have deepened my skills regarding important technological applications such as Excel, Microsoft Word, Google Documents, and presentations. Furthermore, UC Riverside encourages community bonding on a professional level ultimately building skills attributing to our majors. 

I plan to intern at marketing positions to fuel my passion for marketing and management. In addition to internships, I am currently passionate and deeply involved in a marketing association. 
AMA (American Marketing Association) 
relative to major, provides internship opportunities and mentorship
Receive knowledge about different career choices
Encourages social networking 
The association motivates and provides me (as a freshman student) many opportunities. 
In addition to professional clubs, I also plan to run for marketing director in a social club named CSA (Chinese Student Association). I am passionate about promoting and spreading knowledge about products or specific services. 

I am currently involving myself in many ethnic clubs such as:
CSA (Chinese Student Association) 
spreading and appreciating Chinese culture 
Educating myself with Chinese culture 
KASA (Korean American Student Association) 
spreading and appreciating Korean culture 
Diving deeper into korean culture
As mentioned above, I plan to run for a position, but cultural clubs allow me to learn more about my culture and others as well. I learn more about diversity and differences within cultures. 
<br><br>
I am currently a Pre-Business major, but in my third year of college after entering the School of Business, I plan to concentrate in Marketing. Additionally, my family has owned a small business for approximately 8 years. As a result of owning a small business, I am well versed in skills involved in business management. As a student at UC Riverside, my goals include marketing and management for companies. Moreover I envision successfully joining a company that provides a marketing job whether it involves social media, or creative forms of advertisement. To achieve these goals, I am striving to take classes relevant to my major and form connections with peers as well as professors.
